CardioVision – ECG Arrhythmia Detection with Explainability

CardioVision is a deep learning–based ECG arrhythmia detection system built using a CNN–LSTM architecture, deployed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, and enhanced with explainability using gradient-based Class Activation Mapping (CAM).

This project is designed as an academic / final-year project with a strong focus on robust deployment and interpretability.

Features:

CNN–LSTM model for ECG arrhythmia classification

Streamlit-based interactive dashboard

Supports MIT-BIH / PTBDB-style ECG CSV files

Handles variable ECG lengths (e.g., 187 or 216 samples)

Robust inference pipeline (no crashes on invalid inputs)

Gradient-based explainability heatmap for ECG signals

Supports both numeric and symbolic labels (0–4 or N, S, V, F, Q)

Model Overview:

Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network + LSTM

Input: Single ECG beat (1D signal)

Output Classes:

0 – Normal Beat (N)

1 – Supraventricular Ectopic Beat (SVEB)

2 – Ventricular Ectopic Beat (PVC)

3 – Fusion Beat (F)  

4 – Unknown Beat (Q)

⚠️ The trained .h5 model file is not included in this repository due to GitHub size limits.

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run the Streamlit dashboard

🧪 Explainability Approach:

Classical Grad-CAM is often unstable for CNN–LSTM architectures due to temporal dependencies introduced by LSTM layers.

To address this, CardioVision uses a gradient-based CAM on the input ECG signal, which:

Provides reliable temporal importance visualization

Highlights clinically relevant ECG regions

Works consistently at inference time

This approach is commonly adopted in ECG deep learning research.
